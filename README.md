👨‍💻 sudo-man

"I read the documentation so you don't have to. Just kidding, I didn't read it either."

$ whoami

sudo: you are not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported to absolutely nobody.


🚀 Core Competencies

Error-Driven Development (EDD): I keep changing the code until the error message looks different.

Pipeline Whisperer: My primary CI/CD strategy is pushing to main and whispering "PLS Compile 🙏" at the monitor.

Advanced Debugging: Strategically placing console.log("here"), print("wtf"), and println!("why") throughout production codebases.

Threat Mitigation: Completely immune to privilege escalation attacks (I don't have any privileges to escalate).

🧠 The Daily Grind

def deliver_feature(codebase):
    while not working:
        # PLS Compile 🙏
        try:
            rebuild_everything()
        except CompilationError:
            search_stackoverflow("why does my computer hate me")
            blame_the_cache()
            
    return "LGTM 🚀"

Disclaimer: If my code works perfectly on the first try, I assume I'm in the wrong repository.
